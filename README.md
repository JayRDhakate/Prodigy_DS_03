## Task Description: Decision Tree Classifier for Customer Purchase Prediction

### Dataset: Bank Marketing Dataset

#### Basic Understanding of the Dataset:
The Bank Marketing dataset contains information about customers' demographic and behavioral attributes, along with a binary target variable indicating whether a customer subscribed to a product or service.

#### Steps:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
   - Handle missing values.
   - Handle any outliers or anomalies.

2. **Extracting Numerical and Categorical Columns:**
   - Identify features that are numerical and categorical in nature.

3. **Descriptive Statistical Analysis:**
   - Gain insights into the central tendencies and distributions of the numerical features.

4. **Plotting Boxplot and Checking for Outliers:**
   - Visualize the distribution of numerical features and identify any outliers.

5. **Checking for Correlation:**
   - Analyze the correlation between numerical features.

6. **Data Visualization of Numerical and Categorical Columns:**
   - Visualize relationships and distributions of both numerical and categorical features.

7. **Split Data into Features and Target:**
   - Separate the dataset into input features (X) and the target variable (y).

8. **Encode Categorical Variables:**
   - Convert categorical variables into a format suitable for machine learning models.

9. **Train the Decision Tree Classifier:**
   - Implement and train a Decision Tree Classifier on the preprocessed data.

10. **Predictions and Model Evaluation:**
    - Make predictions on a validation set and evaluate the model's performance using relevant metrics.

11. **Plotting Decision Tree:**
    - Visualize the Decision Tree for better interpretability.

### Goal:
Build a robust Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. Leverage the insights gained from the Bank Marketing dataset to enhance the model's accuracy and effectiveness.
